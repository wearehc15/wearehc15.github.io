				<p class="mb-4 lg:mb-6">
					In the heart of our journey lies a collective of 15 remarkable fempreneurs, bound by the unbreakable bonds woven during our time as participants in the EU Fellowship program, The Break. The impact of this experience was profound, touching each of us in ways words struggle to capture. It was more than a program; it was a transformational odyssey that rewrote the stories of our lives.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4 lg:mb-6">
					Such was the resonance, the synergy, the magic of our connection, that we took an awe-inspiring step forward. A step not only towards our dreams but towards the dreams of countless others like us. We forged a path to build, to expand, to grow - an opportunity wrapped in the threads of our collective experiences.
